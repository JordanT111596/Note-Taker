Completed 09/02/2020

This assignment has us create an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application uses an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

As specified in the assignment, a user can write and save notes so that they can organize thoughts and keep track of tasks needing to be completed. When the delete button is hit on the note, it removes previous notes. Now go take some notes!
